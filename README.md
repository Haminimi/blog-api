# Blog API
## Description
A REST API for managing a blog site. [The project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api) is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s Node course within [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s curriculum. The Odin Project provides a high quality web development education maintained by an open source community.
## Live Preview
You can perform all CRUD operations on the API. The easiest ones to check are the GET requests in your browser. In order to retrieve a list of posts and authors, you can visit [/api/posts](https://haminimi-blog-api.glitch.me/api/posts) and [/api/authors](https://haminimi-blog-api.glitch.me/api/authors). For a list of comments for a specific post, you can use the next endpoint [/api/posts/:postId/comments](https://haminimi-blog-api.glitch.me/api/posts/65d0ad2ed0814d06706f37b8/comments) or to get a specific comment visit [/api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId](https://haminimi-blog-api.glitch.me/api/posts/65d0ad2ed0814d06706f37b8/comments/65d0b5dc820417d7532c8d02).
Other CRUD operations may be tested using [cURL](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
